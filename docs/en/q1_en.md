## How to change mode from blacklist to whitelist

If you want the bot to only respond to messages from channels listed in `channel.json` instead of blocking channels listed there, please change the **'mode'** in `config.json`.

No changes needed in `call_api.py`.

Please refer to the [Commands](commands_en.md) for commands in whitelist mode.
